What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) service built into GitHub.
It allows you to automate software development workflows (build, test, deploy, release, etc.) directly from your repository.

🔹 Key Concepts

1. Workflow – An automated process defined in a YAML file (.github/workflows/*.yml) in your repo.


2. Job – A set of steps executed on the same runner. A workflow may have multiple jobs.


3. Step – An individual task (e.g., run a command, use an action).


4. Action – A reusable piece of code (like plugins).


5. Runner – A server/machine where workflows run.

GitHub-hosted runner → managed by GitHub.
